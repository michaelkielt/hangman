## Description

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game  in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts, one letter at a time. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. The game aims to provide an enjoyable and interactive experience for players while demonstrating the use of various data structures such as lists and conditional statements like if-else blocks and while loops in a Python program.

### Project Goals and Learning Objectives

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

- Develop a functioning Hangman game that allows players to:
  - Guess letters to complete the hidden word.
  - Track their progress and remaining guesses.
  - Win by correctly guessing the word or lose by running out of guesses.
- Implement different data structures, including lists to store words, letters, and conditional statements like if-else blocks and while loops for game logic.
- Enhance problem-solving skills by creating algorithms for word selection, word masking, and player-input validation.
